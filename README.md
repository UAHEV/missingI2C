# missingI2C
All the stuff I2C was missing

Missing I2C is a wrapper for various functions that I2C doesn't have on Atmega chips. It is expounded upon as we find more things that we'd like I2C to have. 

## Platforms
Anything that supports [Wire](https://www.arduino.cc/en/reference/wire "Arduino Wire Documentation")

## Usage
Simply add the `missingI2C.cpp` and `missingI2C.h` to your project. Make sure that `wire.h` is accessible from `missingI2C.h`, then run wild :squirrel:
